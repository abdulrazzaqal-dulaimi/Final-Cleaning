          Shine Cleaning is a locally owned cleaning company since 2017. We are
          insured and bonded. Our services are 100% eco-friendly. <br />
          We have adequate training and equipment needed to provide you with an
          excellent cleaning service, <br />
          leaving you satisfied with our work. Over the years, we have grown
          into a preferred cleaning facility for both residential and commercial
          properties, <br />
          as well as other facilities in Vancouver and the surrounding areas. We
          can tackle both large and small projects, as we believe no job is too
          big or too small. <br />
          We know that providing high-quality service means being prepared to
          face anything, which is why we cater to both interior and exterior
          requirements. <br />
          We are best known for our attention-to-detail, as we leave a place
          shining to our best ability. We mostly get repetitive and referral
          clients, <br />
          which says a lot about our work quality and the relation we have built
          with our clients over the years. <br />
          If you have a project in mind and are looking for some answers or a
          free quote, feel free to contact us, and we’ll be happy to help.
